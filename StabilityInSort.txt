A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal 
keys apear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the 
input array to be sorted. Stability doesn't matter when equal elements 
are indistinguishable, such as premitive datatype (integeter), or 
entire object is the key.

Stable Sorting Algorithm:
-Bubble Sort 
-Insertion Sort 
-Merge Sort 
-Counting Sort
-Tim Sort 

Unstable Sorting Algorithm: 
-Selection Sort 
-Quick Sort 
-Heap Sort
